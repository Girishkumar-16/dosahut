        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          Scratchy Tuesday is open to customers dining in at Dosa Hut
          Sunshine Coast (5 Lutana Street, Buddina QLD 4575) on a Tuesday
          who spend $40 or more per table, aged 18 and over, with a valid
          Australian mobile number capable of receiving WhatsApp messages.
          Participation is free.

        <h2>2. Your Scratch Card Odds &amp; Rewards</h2>
        <p>
          Staff provide one QR code per qualifying table, which opens a
          scratch card for that table. Scratching the card reveals one
          outcome, selected at random. Out of every 100 scratches,{" "}
          {100 - SCRATCHY_TUESDAY_LOSE_WEIGHT} reveal a genuine reward and{" "}
          {SCRATCHY_TUESDAY_LOSE_WEIGHT} reveal &ldquo;{SCRATCHY_TUESDAY_LOSE_MESSAGE}&rdquo;
          — no reward for that scratch. The current reward pool, and each
          reward&rsquo;s approximate share of the 100 scratches, is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          {SCRATCHY_TUESDAY_REWARDS.map((reward) => (
            <li key={reward.name}>
              {reward.name} — {reward.weight} in 100
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p>
          The exact odds and reward pool may change from week to week
          without notice.
        </p>

      <section className="flex flex-col gap-3">
        <h2>3. Redeeming Your Reward</h2>
        <p>
          If your scratch reveals a reward, it is valid only for the dine-in
          visit during which you scratched your card. Show the revealed
          reward on your device screen to a staff member before the end of
          that visit — there is no separate reward code to present. Rewards
          cannot be banked, redeemed on a future visit, exchanged for cash,
          or transferred to another person. Free-item rewards are subject to
          availability and may be substituted with a reward of equal or
          greater value at staff&rsquo;s discretion if unavailable. If your
          scratch reveals &ldquo;{SCRATCHY_TUESDAY_LOSE_MESSAGE}&rdquo;, there is
          nothing to redeem for that visit.

        <h2>4. One Scratch Per Table, Per Tuesday</h2>
        <p>
          QR access is provided by staff only to tables that meet the $40+
          spend requirement. Each mobile number may reveal one scratch card
          per Tuesday; submitting the same number again on the same Tuesday
          will not issue an additional reward. A mobile number that has
          already played on a given Tuesday is welcome to play again on a
          future Tuesday, provided the table qualifies again.
